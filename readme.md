# My Data Science Projects
Welcome to my world!! I'm excited to be learning and building out my interest in data science and visualization. My main goal with these repos is to learn as much as I can while using the tools that are on the bleeding edge. This means choosing tools like seaborn over matplotlib and polars over pandas! Another unique decision is using one python file and running line by line (with shift-enter in VSCode) in order to bypass having to use a noteboook and having overall cleaner code. 

Editor: VSCode
